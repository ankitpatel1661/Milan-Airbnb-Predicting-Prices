    "Airbnb has successfully disrupted the traditional hospitality industry as more and more travelers decide to use Airbnb as their primary accommodation provider. Since its inception in 2008, Airbnb has seen an enormous growth, with the number of rentals listed on its website growing exponentially each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Italy, no city is more popular than Milan for tech industry as well as  for tourism industry. That implies that Milan is one of the hottest markets for Airbnb in Europe, with over 18,783 listings as of August 2020. With a size of 181.8 km², this means there are roughly 104 homes being rented out per km² in Berlin on Airbnb!\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the possibility that I might have to relocate for a new data science job, but want to keep my current flate (which is quite cheap!), I might wonder if it could be worth it to offer my jewel on Airbnb. Could this perhaps be a profitable option? However, it is difficult for potential hosts to know what the true value of their home is, and how in-demand their home might be. And since location and furniture are obviously fixed for the most part, is there anything else a host can influence - such as description, communication patterns, and/or additional services to boost their earnings?\n",
    "\n",
    "The following question will drive this project:<br>\n",
    "> **Can we determine a fairly spot-on daily price for a new accommodation that fits into its specific market environment and competitors in Milan?** <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The question focuses on the accommodation features and decisions a new host can make with regards to initial presentation, i.e. posting a picture of him- or herself on the website, determining a minimum length of stay, offering instant bookings etc. A machine learning algorithm will be applied to try to get an answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first notebook, I will perform an analysis of the detailed Milan listings data, sourced from the Inside Airbnb website, in order to understand the rental landscape and try to recommend a price for a newbie entering the market. The dataset is named `listings.csv.gz` and was scraped on September 02nd 2020."
